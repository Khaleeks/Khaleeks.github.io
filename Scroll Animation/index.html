    <!-- Seed Section -->
    <div id="seed">
        <div class="flower-section">
            <span class="flower-text">Beneath the quiet earth, a seed whispers to the dark. Cradled in cool soil, it dreams of skies it has never seen, of light it has never known. Silence wraps it close, but deep within, the pulse of life begins to stir.</span>

    <!-- Sprout Section -->
    <div id="sprout">
        <div class="flower-section">
            <span class="flower-text">A tender sprout breaks the earth with trembling hands, reaching toward a distant sun. Each drop of rain, each breath of wind, a promise and a test. Fragile, yet unyielding, it stretches skyward, craving the warmth of a world it barely understands.</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Full Bloom Section -->
    <div id="bloom">
        <div class="flower-section">
            <span class="flower-text"> In radiant bloom, the flower lifts its face to the sky, a burst of color in the vastness of green. It sways in the rhythm of the wind, its petals unfolding like a whispered secret. The world slows to admire, and for a moment, everything is still, captivated by its grace.</span>
        </div>

    <!-- Petals Falling Section -->
    <div id="petals">
        <div class="flower-section">
            <span class="flower-text"> As time unravels, the petals drift like soft sighs, falling back to the earth from which they rose. Yet even as they fade, new seeds carry the memory of the dance of life. The cycle turns again, as the flower's quiet legacy is scattered on the wind, waiting to bloom anew.</span>
