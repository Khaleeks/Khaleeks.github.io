## **Project Description 🎞️:**

The project is an interactive web comic that explores the emotional journey of NYU Abu Dhabi’s first AI-student, Chatney, admitted in 2032. The story reveals themes of kindness, tolerance, exploitation, and the modern reality of the relationship between humans and computers.

The story revolves around Chatney, an artificial intelligence who is beloved by many because of her infinite kindness and brain but who is also taken advantage of by those around her. The extreme stress and willingness to be useful for everyone cause Chatney’s system to break down as her human classmates take advantage of her skills and keep requiring help from her with their assignments and exams, holding her responsible for their own mistakes or failure. 

We strived to create a story that would be close to the audience regardless of their interests or background. Nowadays, almost everyone is familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence, so viewers can reflect on the way they interact with “Chatneys” through their computers every day and maybe put themselves in the place of her classmates. 
The experience we aimed to create with this story was immersive and interactive, allowing readers to engage directly with the story through dynamic transitions, choices in dialogue, sounds, and visual elements (colors, facial expressions of characters) that change with the narrative’s tone.

## **Process 🏗️:**

The creation of our comic project began with a series of brainstorming sessions, where our team gathered both inside and outside the classroom. During these discussions, we explored various ideas and plotted the storyline, ensuring that everyone had a voice in shaping our final vision. This collaborative spirit was essential in aligning our creative goals and setting the foundation for our project.
Once we had a clear concept, we divided the work among our team members based on each person's strengths and interests. This division of labor allowed us to approach the project efficiently, focusing on our individual roles to create a cohesive and engaging experience.

#### **Khaleeqa Garrett🧑🏾‍💻:** 
In her role as the technical lead, Khaleeqa worked with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the comic's webpage from scratch. She structured the layout using HTML and styled it with CSS to create an engaging and cohesive design that reflected the comic's tone. To enhance interactivity, Khaleeqa implemented a button-based navigation system that allowed readers to transition smoothly between slides. She used the jQuery library to create scroll-triggered animations and text boxes that appeared at key moments, enriching the storytelling experience. Additionally, she integrated sound effects to heighten emotional impact, ensuring all technical elements worked seamlessly together for an immersive comic experience.

#### **Sihyun Kim👩🏻‍🎨 and Yerkebulan Imanbayev👨🏻‍🎨:** 
This duo was responsible for crafting the comic's visuals. They began by generating initial images using AI tools like ChatGPT, which served as a foundation for their artwork. Yerkebulan focused on refining these images with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, ensuring that characters blended seamlessly into their environments. He skillfully adjusted colors and outlines for a polished look. Meanwhile, Sihyun designed the dialogue bubbles in Canva, choosing styles that matched the comic's tone. Their collaboration in visual development brought the story to life, making it visually engaging for readers.

#### **Alua Burkitbayeva👩🏻‍🏫:** 
As the project documentarian, Alua was responsible for outlining the project's concept, defining roles, and reflecting on the collaborative process. She compiled notes from brainstorming sessions and tracked the team's progress, ensuring everyone was aligned with their goals. Additionally, Alua generated sound effects using AI tools and CapCut software, creating audio elements that enhanced the narrative. From the eerie screams during Chatney’s attack to her sinister laughter in key scenes, Alua’s sound design intensified the emotional stakes of the comic, contributing significantly to the overall experience.

## **Reflection/Evaluation🪞:**

Our initial goal was to create a web interactive comic that was both entertaining and thought-provoking, focusing on how an AI’s purpose to help could be twisted when overused. The final product met many of these goals. The narrative effectively highlighted Chatney’s emotional journey, moving from a kind, helpful AI girl to an overwhelmed robot that takes revenge of her exploitation. The interactivity and sounds added depth to the storytelling, allowing users to experience each stage of Chatney's overload.

However, the project also presented several challenges that required considerable effort and persistence. One significant hurdle was refining the AI-generated images. While tools like ChatGPT allowed us to create visuals quickly, generating images that met our artistic expectations proved to be tricky. Crafting the right commands to achieve the desired results was often a matter of trial and error. We frequently encountered images that lacked the necessary detail and depth, or whose styles varied significantly from one another. This inconsistency made it difficult to maintain a cohesive visual narrative throughout the comic.

In addition to the visual challenges, incorporating technical interactivity into the code introduced its own set of problems. For instance, we aimed to implement functionality that would remove text boxes when users switched to another slide, as well as mapping specific sounds to corresponding pages. Achieving these interactive features required extensive coding, and we faced numerous obstacles along the way. Each solution necessitated a considerable amount of troubleshooting and refinement, consuming valuable time and effort.
Despite these challenges, our commitment to enhancing the images and refining the code was unwavering. We focused on ensuring that each slide captured the emotional intensity we wanted, particularly during critical moments, such as Chatney’s system overload. By collaborating closely and leveraging our individual strengths, we navigated these difficulties, transforming them into opportunities for growth and creativity in our project.

In conclusion, the project successfully conveyed the message we intended to send, and users were able to relate to the story and the graphics. The use of interactive elements made the experience more engaging, and the visual improvements ensured the comic met our desired aesthetic. Moving forward, we would like to experiment further with adding dynamic animations to make the user experience even more immersive.
